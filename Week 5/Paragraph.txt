Here is why I decided to go with Style Tile 1. I like the design that I put in it
because it is colorful but not too busy where it is distracting. I do like in the second
design how it is simple but I do not like the color scheme as it seems too dark and
boring. The first one was my favorite for the engaging element but it does the job
with readability and ease of use. Just creating these style tiles gives me all the
thinking I need for this website since I know most of the sports and basic moves with
them, I do not really need a full comp because I can always tweak the wording a little
later on, so just the style tiles will work for me because I am looking for the
design element of the website and not so much the content. I spend about the same amount
of time on each, about 30 minutes per tile. I can get by with just a style tile and
no real need for a full comp.
